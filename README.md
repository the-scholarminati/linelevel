# Git Flow

- create fork via github
- clone to local repo
- // if feature branch does not exist
- make branch on local repo: git checkout -b branch-name
- push branch to upstream: git push upstream branch-name
- // repeat from here if making changes to existing feature
- make changes to branch until ready to push       
- rebase from dev:  git rebase (--continue | --skip | --abort)
- fix conflicts: git pull --rebase upstream dev
- push to forked branch: git push origin branch-name
- create pull request: base team-repo:dev compare your-forked-repo:branch-name
- repeat until feature is complete


# Contributing
(please add any instructions other team members need to know to run your code here)

To get started, fork and clone the repo, then run
```
npm install
```
to install the dependencies.



To run the test suite, you may need to globally install a few dependencies:

```
npm install -g karma
npm install -g karma-jasmine
npm install -g karma-coverage
npm install -g karma-chrome-launcher
npm install -g karma-ng-html2js-preprocessor
```
To run the actual tests, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command
```
karma start
```
A new browser window should open stating that Karma connected successfully.


Please use lint by running
```
gulp lint
